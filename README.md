Metadata for the MS Analyses

This is the dataset and code for the MS titled: "Insects and non-woody plants slow down tropical forest succession: a community-wide experiment in Papua New Guinea".

(A). Datasets

Three datasets are used for the analyses. Dataset "Combine_Sites_Biomass_2023" is used for main MS results while datasets "All_Insects_abundance" and "Herbivores_abundance" are used for supporting information. 

**Below is the explaination of the data that are presented in each columns and rows of "Combine_Sites_Biomass_2023" dataset.**  
(1). Column 1 ("Elev") is the abbreviation for Elevation and contains the two elevations; 700m and 1700m in which the experiments were situated. 
(2). Column 2 ("Blocks") are the actual gaps in the forest (0.2 ha) in which the treatment plots were established. 
(3). Column 3 ("Treatments") contains the treatment plots: Control (C), Insecticide treatment (I), Weeding (W), and Weeding+insecticide treatment (WI). 
(4). Column 4 ("Plant_sp") contains the plant species. 
(5). Column 5 ("Family") contains the plant species families.
(6). Column 6 ("Plants") contains non-woody and woody group.
(7). Column 7 ("Growth_Form") contains the growth forms of the plant species.
(8). Column 8 ("Status") categorises the plants to either alien or native.
(9). Column 9 ("Biomass_kg") contains the fresh weights of individal plants in kg.
